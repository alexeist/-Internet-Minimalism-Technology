The era of baroque in the computer's net www (internet owned by corp. ICANN) is coming to the end. Our world is now entering a new era of classic interaction between form and content of websites.
The typical starting method for this is BMI internet minimalism technology. BMI is a web application development method that assigns a minimum value to a form and, on the contrary, assigns a maximum value to the content. Ideally, the entire website should be one index.php file.
