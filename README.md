The free http-sites with Open Sourse Transparent Development Standard (OSTDS) is ready. This standard is easy to use for strongly publishing of the content aims. The script was written in PHP, includes one single index.php file few hundred bytes long. The http sites on the base of this technology is very fast and usefull good in the Extern Computers Net (ecn.) with home or office's relative slow machines and low WiFi connections each to others local nets.

The era of baroque in the computer's net www (internet owned by corp. ICANN) is coming to the end. Our world is now entering a new era of classic interaction between form and content of websites.
The typical starting method for this is BMI internet minimalism technology. BMI is a web application development method that assigns a minimum value to a form and, on the contrary, assigns a maximum value to the content. Ideally, the entire website should be one index.php file.
